Advanced Data Structures Library

Project Overview:
The Advanced Data Structures Library is a comprehensive implementation of several advanced data structures in the C programming language. The project includes the implementation of an AVL tree, a Red-Black tree, and a B-tree, each of which is a crucial data structure for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Project Goals:

1. Educational Value: Provide a deep understanding of advanced data structures, their properties, and their operations. This includes insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal techniques.
   
2. Practical Application: Implement these data structures in a way that they can be used in real-world applications, such as databases, file systems, and network applications, where efficient data handling is crucial.

3. Performance Optimization: Showcase the importance of balancing and self-balancing data structures to maintain optimal performance in terms of time complexity for various operations.

4. Code Quality and Maintainability: Develop clean, modular, and well-documented code that adheres to best practices in C programming. This ensures the code is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

Included Data Structures:

1. AVL Tree:
   - A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of the left and right subtrees is no more than one for all nodes.
   - Provides efficient operations with O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search.

2. Red-Black Tree:
   - A self-balancing binary search tree with an additional property of node colors (red or black) that ensures the tree remains balanced.
   - Guarantees O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search.

3. B-Tree:
   - A balanced tree data structure that generalizes the binary search tree to allow for nodes with more than two children.
   - Optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.

Key Features:

- **Modular Design:** Each data structure is implemented in separate header and source files for easy inclusion in other projects.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Includes test cases for each data structure to verify correctness and performance.
- **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation in the form of comments within the code and a README file explaining how to build, test, and use the library.

Usage Scenarios:

- Educational Purposes: Students and educators can use this library to learn and teach advanced data structures.
- Software Development: Developers can integrate these data structures into their projects to improve data handling efficiency.
- Research and Experimentation: Researchers can use this library as a basis for experimenting with new data structure algorithms and improvements.

Conclusion:
The Advanced Data Structures Library aims to provide a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use implementation of essential advanced data structures in C. By doing so, it supports educational goals, practical application in software development, and further research in the field of computer science.
